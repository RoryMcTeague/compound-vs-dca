# Compound Interest vs Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

This project compares two common investment strategies over time:

1. **Compound Interest** – a one-off lump sum investment that grows through compounded returns.  
2. **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)** – regular monthly contributions regardless of market conditions.

We simulate both strategies using a fixed annual return and visualise how each performs over a 10-year period.

## Requirements
