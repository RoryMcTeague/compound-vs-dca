# Compound Interest vs Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

This project compares two common investment strategies over time:

1. **Compound Interest** – a one-off lump sum investment that grows through compounded returns.  
2. **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)** – regular monthly contributions regardless of market conditions.

We simulate both strategies using a fixed annual return and visualize how each performs over a 10-year period.

## Contents

- `compound_vs_dca.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full simulation and visualization (with **user inputs** for initial investment, monthly contributions, and annual return rate).

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required library using:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## How to Run:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/compound_interest_vs_dca.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd compound_interest_vs_dca
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook compound_vs_dca.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the notebook cells to interact with the investment simulation.

## Example Input (for the Jupyter Notebook):
```text
Enter your initial investment amount: 1000
Enter your monthly contribution: 100
Enter expected annual return (in percentage, e.g. 7 for 7%): 7
Enter the number of years for investment: 10
```

## Example Output:
A graph showing the growth of your investment over time with both the **Compound Interest** and **Dollar-Cost Averaging** strategies.

## Future Enhancements:
- Add more advanced financial models (e.g., tax considerations, inflation adjustment).
- Allow users to input additional variables like one-time lump sum investments or withdrawal rates.
- Add an option for users to save their investment data to a file for future analysis.
